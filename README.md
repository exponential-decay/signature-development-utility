=============================

PRONOM/DROID Signature Development Utility source code, first written in late 2011. 

This application is hosted by The National Archives: http://test.linkeddatapronom.nationalarchives.gov.uk/sigdev/index.htm
and mirrored on my own site: http://exponentialdecay.co.uk/sd/index.htm

This code is hosted here to enable it to be built upon and improved by myself and others. The first point of call
will be to build unit tests to help unravel some of the complexity of the code and make it more modular. There are
also a handful of known issues to be dealt with, see the issues log for more information.
